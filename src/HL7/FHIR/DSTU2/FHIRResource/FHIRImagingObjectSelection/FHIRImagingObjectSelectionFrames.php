Reflecting that range of purposes, typical ImagingObjectSelection resources may include all SOP Instances in a study (perhaps for sharing through a Health Information Exchange); key images from multiple studies (for reference by a referring or treating physician); a multi-frame ultrasound instance ("cine" video clip) and a set of measurements taken from that instance (for inclusion in a teaching file); and so on.
